# Deep-Learning-Assignmets
My team's implementations for Deep Learning assignmets for Deep Learning course at University of Freiburg.<br />
The assignments have been implemnted by team of two (Abdelrahman Younes and Naya Baslan).<br />
Assignment 1: Tensor Manipulation<br />
Assignment 2: Feedforward implementation<br />
Assignment 3: Backpropagation implementation<br />
Assignment 4: Optimization<br />
Assignment 5: Regularization<br />
Assignment 6: CNN implemntation<br />
Assignment 8: CNN archtiectures <br />
Assignment 9: Hyper parameter optimization <br />
